### Hello There!

Hello, You maybe recognise me from PR's, Twitter, Twitch or maybe Haxe's Discord if it's Miss Muffin.

I Code with Haxe mainly, It's really easy to start if you haven't tried it!

Right now I'm not working on anything yet, Just a few jams that I may participate here and there.

I'm learning about Haxe, Because I'm a newbie.

My pronouns are Unknown, I want ppl to say with some random pronouns LOL

If you want to talk to me for some reason, You can access my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mrcheemsandfriends)
