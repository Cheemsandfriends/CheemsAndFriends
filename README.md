### Hello There!

Hello, You maybe recognise me from PR's, Twitter, Twitch or maybe Haxe's Discord if it's Miss Muffin.

I Code with Haxe mainly, It's really easy to start if you haven't tried it! It's like AS3 but with the possibility of exporting it to different Shit like C, php, etc. and It's free and open-source so why not?

Right now I'm not working on anything yet, Just a few jams that I may participate here and there.

I'm learning about Haxe, Because I'm a newbie.

My pronouns are Unknown, I want ppl to say with some random pronouns LOL

If you want to talk to me for some reason, You can access my [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/@me): Miss Muffin#8930
